 * @brief Debugging exercise; contains the definitions for a Node
 * and a Queue.
 *
 * @details This file contains the definitions for a Node and a Queue.
 * This code will read lines of input until the end of the file is reached
 * (Ctrl-D from the terminal), and then it will print out the first
 * `NUM_OUTPUT` lines of the input. If a line is longer than `BUFFER_SIZE`,
 * it will be treated as separate lines (due to the behavior of `fgets`).
