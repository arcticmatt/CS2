To implement the seam carving algorithm recursively, one could use a
brute force technique and try to analyze all the seams. Assuming seams
are only going down, the base case would be when you reach the bottom of
the picture. The recursive step would go from one pixel to every other
pixel in the downward direction (3 pixels if not on the edge, 2 if on the edge).
This method would be called on every
pixel at the top of the image. The complexity of this algorithm for an
NxN image is O(N3^N). Thus, for a 50x50 image, it would take
3.59e16 seconds if 1 billion computations were made per second.
