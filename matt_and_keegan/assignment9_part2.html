<h1>CS2 Assignment 9: Othello - Part 2</h1>
<h2>Due <span style="color: #f00">Monday</span>, March 17, 2014, at 24:00 PST

<hr />

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This is <b>Part 2</b> of a two-part CS2 assignment on Othello. 
<a href="assignment9_part1.html">For <b>Part 1</b>, click here.</a></p>
<hr />

<h2>Assignment Background</h2>

<p>Recall that we could simply generate a decision tree down to a practical
depth and choose the branch where the smallest possible end score within that
branch is the highest such score across all branches.  However, this is an
inefficient approach, since we spend a lot of time considering branches that
will end up being worse than branches we have already considered or that our
opponent would never let us reach. If we could stop ourselves from tracing too
far into these, we could save time, allowing us to look deeper with the time we
have.</p>

<h3>Alpha-Beta Pruning</h3>
<p>To accomplish this, we could use an idea called <span
    class="keyword">alpha-beta pruning</span>. As we construct the decision
tree, we keep track of two statistics: <span class="hilite">alpha is our best
overall score</span>, and <span class="hilite">beta is the opponent's best
overall score</span> (i.e., our worst overall score). 
We start alpha at some large negative number and beta at
some large positive number; as we traverse the tree, we increase alpha (since
we try to maximize), and we decrease beta (since the opponent tries to
minimize). If at any point we discover that making a move would set alpha
greater than beta, we need not trace further into that subtree, since that
represents a "mistake" made by some side; either we have made a bad move that
allowed the opponent to drive the minimum score too low, or the opponent has
made a bad move that allowed us to drive the maximum score too high. In any
case, the entire subtree resulting from that decision need not be explored
further.</p>

<p>
Consider the following minimax tree, where the numbers are the scores for the
maximizing player:

<div align="center">

(source: 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:AB_pruning.svg">Wikipedia</a>)
</div>

<p>
Try keeping track of the alpha and beta values as you traverse the tree in
depth-first fashion (from left to right); you will see how this allows us
to avoid exploring the parts of the tree in gray. For example, consider what
happens when we reach the right subtree (rooted at the 5 in the 2nd layer).
At this point, alpha is 6, since the middle subtree has guaranteed us at least
that score. Thus, when we begin traversing the right subtree and find that 
the opponent can at least minimize our score to 5, we know there is no reason
to continue exploring the rest of the subtree, since the middle subtree is 
guaranteed to be better.
</p>

<h3>Iterative Deepening</h3>
<p>The danger with conducting our search to a large depth is that, if a
position has a high branching factor, we could run out of time and end up with
a bad result if we haven't explored all of the branches. To avoid this, 
we can employ a strategy called <span class="keyword">
iterative deepening</span>. Instead of immediately trying to run minimax down 
to a large depth,
we can start from a relatively shallow depth (that we know will run in time).
Then, while we still have time, we can repeatedly run minimax, increasing the
depth limit each time. This way, if we are interrupted due to time constraints,
we can fall back to the result from a shallower depth (although not necessarily
optimal, it's usually better than a result from an incomplete search).
</p>

<p>
Hopefully, these ideas are enough to get you started, but there are 
<span class="keyword">many</span> other techniques (opening books,
transposition tables, etc.) that can be used to improve your AI.
Feel free to read up on such techniques.
</p>

<div class="hint"><p>
For this assignment, you are free to read up on any resources that might help 
you, and we encourage you to! The only exception to this is looking at actual 
source code in any non-pseudocode language.</p>

<h3>Compiler Optimizations</h3>
<p>In addition to the above algorithmic techniques to improve your AI's 
performance, you can also gain some extra speed by letting 
<span class="code">g++</span> optimize your code during compilation. So far 
in this course, you've been compiling all your code with the lowest optimization
level -O0 (by default) and debugging symbols (-ggdb); while this is great for
debugging, your programs can potentially run much faster at higher
optimization levels. Here are brief descriptions of the different levels:

<ul>
    <li><span class="code">-O0</span><br />
Reduce compilation time and make debugging produce the expected results. This is the default.
    </li>    
    <li><span class="code">-O</span><br />
The compiler tries to reduce code size and execution time, without performing any optimizations that take a great deal of compilation time.
    </li>        
    <li><span class="code">-O1</span><br />
Optimize. Optimizing compilation takes somewhat more time, and a lot more memory for a large function.
    </li>    
    <li><span class="code">-O2</span><br />
Optimize even more. GCC performs nearly all supported optimizations that do not involve a space-speed tradeoff. As compared to -O, this option increases both compilation time and the performance of the generated code.
    </li>
    <li><span class="code">-O3</span><br />
Optimize yet more. -O3 turns on all optimizations specified by -O2 and also turns on the -finline-functions, -funswitch-loops, -fpredictive-commoning, -fgcse-after-reload, -ftree-vectorize and -fipa-cp-clone options.
    </li>    
</ul>
</p>

<p>
To choose a optimization level, simply add the appropriate flag to the 
<span class="code">CFLAGS</span> variable in your Makefile (and remove
the <span class="code">-ggdb</span> keyword). So for optimization level
<span class="code">-O2</span>, you would have:
</p>

<div class="code">CFLAGS = -Wall -ansi -pedantic -O2</div>

<p>
Remember to re-test your AI when changing optimization levels!
Higher optimization levels do not necessarily guarantee more speed
(especially when going from <span class="code">-O2</span> to 
<span class="code">-O3</span>). In addition, while very rare, higher 
optimization levels can may make your program execute differently
(although this generally only happens if you've done something non-standard
in your code). Finally, try to test your AI on a cluster machine, since we'll
be running the tournament on those machines.

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>These are the prerequisites for getting this assignment to compile 
(ubuntu package names):
    <ul>
    <li>g++ 4.6.x+</li>
    <li>openjdk-6-jre</li>    
    <li>openjdk-6-jdk (optional - only if you want to use Java)
    </ul>
Ask a TA if you need help retrieving these packages, or if these packages appear 
to be missing from the CS cluster.</p>

<h2>Assignment (20 points)</h2>

<p>For this week, your goal is to continue improving your AI. You will earn points
by crushing some benchmark AI opponents in the tournament.</p>

<p><div class="points easy">5</div>
    Beat <b>ConstantTimePlayer</b> (performs a quick evaluation of moves, then chooses one).</p>
<p><div class="points hard">5</div>
    Beat <b>BetterPlayer</b> (recursively evaluates moves to depth 3, then chooses the best move).</p>
<p><div class="points hard">3</div>
    Beat <b>OogeePlayer</b> (similar to BetterPlayer, recursing to depth 4 with different parameters). <span class="emph">The OogeePlayer player will not be provided to you.</span></p>
<p><div class="points hard">2</div>
    Beat <b>DeepKwok</b> (maintains an opening book, uses alpha-beta pruning, uses a transposition table, searches as far as it thinks it can within time limit). <span class="emph">The DeepKwok player will not be provided to you.</span></p>
<p><div class="points">0.5</div>
    Beat a TA's AI (0.5 points <span class="emph">each</span>)</p>    

<p>You may earn points for each objective by either defeating each opponent at least once during the tournament, or outranking each opponent in the final tournament standings. Draws are judged in your favor, except where caused by an error (in which case judgment is passed by the TAs).</p>

<br />
<p>In addition to your AI bot, fill in the <span class="code">README.txt</span> file 
in your repository with the following (make sure to <span class="hilite">git add</span> it when committing):
</p>

<p><div class="points easy">2</div>
Describe how and what each group member contributed for the past two weeks. If you
are solo, these points will be part of the next section.</p>

<p><div class="points easy">3</div>
Document the improvements that your group made to your AI to make it tournament-worthy.
Explain why you think your strategy(s) will work. Feel free to discuss any ideas were
tried but didn't work out.</p>

<p>
Remember, the tournament will take place on
<b>Tuesday, March 18, at 5:00 PM</b> in <b>Annenberg 104 (computer cluster)</b>, and will be publicly viewable. We will be providing refreshments (pizza and drinks) if you want to come by and watch - it should be fun!</p>

<p>On the day of the tournament, you will be able to view realtime standings at: </p>
