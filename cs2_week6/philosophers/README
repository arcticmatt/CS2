GREEDY
The greedy "solution" works as follows. Each philosopher picks up both
the fork on his left and the fork on his right. He then eats, then
releases both forks, then repeats the process.
This "solution" will always deadlock because
when each philosopher greedily tries to pick up the fork on the left,
they will all be waiting forever to pick up the fork on the right. This
is because each philosopher only releases a fork after he has grabbed both
and eaten. But this scenario can never happen if each philosopher has a
fork in the same hand. Thus deadlock happens.

MAX NUMBER
The max number of philosophers that can sit at the table at any one time is
4. This is because if there are 4 at a table, then there will always be
at least one philosopher that can eat (because he will have two free forks).

CHANDY/MISRA
If this solution began from a state where all philosophers begin with
dirty, left forks, deadlock would happen. This is because each philosopher
would request the right fork from his neighbor. The neighbor would give
the right fork after cleaning it, because all the forks are originally
dirty. But then each philosopher would have a clean fork in his right
hand, so nobody would be able to eat.
