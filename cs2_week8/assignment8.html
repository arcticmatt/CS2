<h1>CS2 Assignment 8: Numerics</h1>
<h2>Due Tuesday, March 4, 2014, at 17:00</h2>

<hr />

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This is the CS2 assignment on numerics. You will be implementing a
numeric integrators, root solvers, a Discrete Fourier Transform, and a
spectral synthesizer.</p>

<p>When finished, please enclose your submission as a ZIP file named 
<span class="code">cs2week8-[NAME].zip</span> or a tar.gz file named 
<span class="code">cs2week8-[NAME].tar.gz</span>, and upload it to the 
Week 8 assignment module on Moodle.</p>

<h2>Assignment Background</h2>

<p>Today, we use computers to do a <b>lot</b> of numerical computations,
particularly in the sciences; whether you use a graphing calculator
or <i>Mathematica</i>, you almost certainly use some kind of
computerized system for doing calculations you would rather not do by
hand. Sometimes, we need computers to perform calculations that
we cannot do on paper. In this assignment, you will explore several
canonical examples of numerical methods with C++.</p>

<h3>Numerically solving differential equations</h3>

<p>Differential equations are ubiquitous throughout the sciences,
but not all differential equations have closed-form solutions; even
so, we might still like to get some useful information from them.
What we cannot solve analytically, we <i>can</i> solve numerically.
Three common algorithms of numerically integrating differential
equations are the forward, backward, and symplectic Euler methods.</p>

<p>All three of the Euler methods follow a similar pattern: Figure
out the next state by updating the current state according to some
rule to approximate the equations of motion of the system that is being
simulated. The update rules are defined differently for each method,
however. Consider some system with a position <i>x</i> and
velocity <i>v</i>; we have only the functional form of the
acceleration, <i>f(x, t) = dv/dt</i>. If we use the forward Euler method,
then the position <i>x</i> after <i>n</i> timesteps will be given
by</p>

<center><img src="images/ForwardEuler.gif" /></center>

<p>where Î´ is a small timestep. Thus, we find out the next position
and velocity by examining only the current position and velocity. Note
that we can find them in either order, since the new velocity does not
depend on the new position.</p>

<p>How might we go about this differently? We could do something really
extreme and base the next step on the next step; don't panic yet, though,
because it's not that bad. The update rule becomes</p>

<center><img src="images/BackwardEuler.gif" /></center>

<p>After seeing the equations, maybe you've realized what to do. If we
substitute the first equation into the second one, we get an equation in
terms of the new position, old position, and old velocity (one unknown).
After solving this equation, we can find the new position and thus the
new velocity. This is the backward Euler.</p>

<p>We have one left - symplectic Euler. It is actually very similar to
the forward Euler, and its update rule is given below.</p>

<center><img src="images/SymplecticEuler.gif" /></center>

<p>As you can see, we make only one change from forward Euler: We use
the new velocity to calculate the new position instead of using the
current velocity. All of the Euler methods behave somewhat differently
after many timesteps, an effect that you will observe in this week's
assignment.</p>

<h3>Numerically finding roots</h3>

<p>Just like not every differential equation can be solved in an exact
way, there are some analytic functions that do not have closed-form
solutions, even when a root obviously exists. Hopefully, you have
already encountered some of these in your studies. We'll discuss two
methods of finding roots of functions for which we know the analytic
form.</p>

<p>A simple (but powerful) approach is to assume we know that a
single root exists between two endpoints <i>[a, b]</i>. We examine the
midpoint of the interval as a first guess for the location of the
root; call this point <i>m</i>. If <i>f(m)</i> has the same sign as
<i>f(a)</i>, then <i>m</i> should be the new "low" limit in the
interval; otherwise, we set <i>m</i> to be the new "high" limit. The
location of the root is guaranteed to be in this updated interval, and
we have increased the precision to which we know its location. Call the
new interval <i>[a', b']</i>. Formally, the precision is now
|<i>b' - a'</i>|, where "|.|" is the absolute value function. We can
continue this process, in a loop, until we find the root or until we
have the answer to within the precision we want. A decent illustration
is shown below, <b>image courtesy clear.rice.edu</b>. One disadvantage to
this method is that it converges in linear time; we might like to do
better than that.</p>

<center><img src="images/Bisection.png" /></center>

<p>A more sophisticated method of root-finding is the Newton-Raphson
or just Newton method; it relies on Taylor's theorem. We begin with
a single guess for the location of the root, <i>not</i> an interval
this time, and we also require the analytic form of the first derivative
of the function. Call the guess <i>x0</i>; we can expand around this point
to find</p>

<center><img src="images/Taylor.gif" /></center>

<p>Specifically, we want <i>f(x) = 0</i>, which allows us to solve for
the unknown <i>x</i>, approximately; call this guess <i>x1</i>. It is</p>

<center><img src="images/Taylor2.gif" /></center>

<p>As before, this method can be iterated until we have found the root
or until we have found it to the precision we want. A good approximation
of this precision is <i>|f(xn) / f'(xn)|</i>, where <i>xn</i> is the
last guess for the root we made. You can study the figure below,
<b>image courtesy chem.sc.edu</b>, to help you visualize this method.</p>

<center><img src="images/NewtonRaphson.gif" /></center>

<h3>Discrete Fourier Transform</h3>

<p>I will summarize Fourier's theorem here without proof. Given
any periodic function <i>f(x)</i>, we can approximate <i>f(x)</i>
by</p>

<center><img src="images/FourierApprox.gif" /></center>

<p>As <i>n</i> approaches infinity, we approach the function <i>f</i>
exactly:</p>

<center><img src="images/FourierExact.gif" /></center>

<p>The image below may be familiar to you; it shows discrete Fourier
series approximations of a square wave. As the order of the approximation
increases, it approaches the true shape of the function.</p>

<center><img src="images/FourierTransforms.gif" /></center>

<p>That seems like a really cool result, if we had an exact functional
form for <i>f</i>. If we just have empirical data (which might have
errors!), there's a problem. The Discrete Fourier Transform provides
a way around that issue by transforming an arbitrary data array
from the time domain to the frequency domain (where you can imagine
"domain" to mean "the x-axis"). Thus, the result of the DFT is
intensity as a function of frequency instead of as a function of
time. This is incredibly useful if you want to know what components
make up a complex signal, which is why the DFT is used so liberally
throughout signal analysis and processing. You will be asked to implement
the DFT only; we do not expect you to prove any theorems.</p>

root solvers.</p>

<h3>Solving a physical system numerically: Planetary orbits</h3>

<div class="quote">All of the objectives in this section should be
completed in the <span class="code">orbits</span> subdirectory.</div>

<h4>Euler methods of integration</h4>

<p>In the Assignment Background, I gave the equations for the three
Euler methods; now, you will write them for a specific physical
system, a planet orbiting a star. Open
<span class="code">src/EulerIntegrator.cpp</span>; the functions you will
write are members of the <span class="code">EulerIntegrator</span>
namespace &mdash; keep the differences between namespaces and classes
in mind! You will write the <span class="code">forward_euler</span>,
<span class="code">backward_euler</span>, and
<span class="code">symplectic_euler</span> functions inside this
namespace; we've provided the function declarations for you.</p>

<div class="hint">You'll notice that none of those functions return
anything; instead, we use the behavior of pointers to update the values
of the input variables. Make sure you don't overwrite a value until
you're done with it! The inputs are <span class="code">x, y</span> for
position and <span class="code">vx, vy</span> for velocity. The small
timestep is passed in the argument <span class="code">h</span>.</div>

<p>Also, circular orbits are <i>boring</i>, so we'll be using eccentric
orbits to make things more interesting. For our purposes, the equations
below give the acceleration in the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> directions:</p>

<center><img src="images/Orbits.gif" /></center>

<p><div class="points easy">1</div>Implement the forward Euler method
in <span class="code">forward_euler</span>.</p>

<p><div class="points easy">1</div>Implement the symplectic Euler method
in <span class="code">symplectic_euler</span>.</p>

<p><div class="points easy">2</div>For some systems, solving the
simultaneous equations to get equations for backward Euler is relatively
simple; unfortunately, this is not the case for the elliptic orbit
equations. Instead of asking you to find a way to do this, we will
instead ask you to make an assumption that will make the problem easier:
If the eccentricity of the orbit is 0 (i.e. the orbit is circular), then
the denominator in the acceleration function is a constant; it is
equal to the cube of the radius of the circle. Furthermore, for our
system, the radius is 1. With this in mind, implement the backward
Euler method in <span class="code">backward_euler</span>, using the
simplifying assumption described above.</p>

<p>To test any of these methods, run <span class="code">bin/orbits</span>
from a terminal prompt. You can use 'b' to select the backward Euler,
'f' to select the forward Euler, and 's' to select the symplectic Euler;
to quit at any time, use 'q' or Escape.</p>

<p><div class="points easy">1</div>Observe your orbiting systems for
a while (this shouldn't actually take that long) so that you can see
their long-term behavior. You should observe three distinct end cases
for the three methods. In a file <span class="code">README</span>,
describe the behaviors of the three methods in your own words. Which one
produces the most accurate long-term behavior? You can use the energy
value printed at the terminal to help you; remember that energy should
be (roughly) constant because we are approximating a bound system.</p>

<h4>Function root solving</h4>

<p>A different way to solve the same system is with numerical function
solvers. In the Assignment Background, I described a couple of very
common methods of finding roots of analytic functions. Here, you will
implement them in the <span class="code">Solver</span> namespace,
found in <span class="code">src/Solver.cpp</span>. We have provided
function headers for you.</p>

<p><div class="points easy">1</div>Implement the bisection method for
finding the root of an arbitrary analytic function, which takes
a single value as input and outputs a single value, in the
<span class="code">bisection</span> method. Continue to solve until
your precision is less than or equal to
<span class="code">PRECISION</span>.</p>

<p><div class="points easy">2</div>Implement the Newton-Raphson method for
finding the root of an arbitrary analytic function, which takes
a single value as input and outputs a single value, in the
<span class="code">newton_raphson</span> method. Continue to solve until
your precision is less than or equal to
<span class="code">TOLERANCE</span>.</p>

<p><div class="points easy">1</div>Test your new solvers by writing
a simple testsuite, in <span class="code">src/testsuite.cpp</span>,
solving a few analytically-solvable equations and a few
non-analytically-solvable ones. Show that they both converge
to the same root, and make sure it is the correct one.
<a href="www.wolframalpha.com">Wolfram|Alpha</a> can help you determine
the correct answer for many non-analytic problems. Make sure your
testsuite prints out useful information; at minimum, you should print
the function you are finding the root for, the correct answer, and the
answer your numerical function found.</p>

<p>To get the shape of the orbit, we will solve an equation of the
form</p>

<center><img src="images/OrbitEquation.gif" /></center>

<p>using the Newton-Raphson solver you just wrote. This code has already
been written for you. To test it, run <span class="code">bin/orbits</span>
from a terminal prompt. You can use 'n' to select the Newton-Raphson
solver; to quit at any time, use 'q' or Escape.</p>

<h3>Discrete and Fast Fourier Transforms</h3>

<div class="quote">All of the objectives in this section should be
completed in the <span class="code">fourier</span> subdirectory.</div>

<p><div class="points easy">1</div>First, we want to make sure you
conceptually understand the DFT. Consider the simple case of an
input that is a pure sine wave. What should the Fourier transform
(not the DFT!) look like? How might the DFT of the same signal look
different, keeping in mind that it is discrete? What would you
reasonably expect to happen as the function becomes more and more
complicated? Place your responses to these questions in a file
called <span class="code">README</span> in the base directory
of your assignment.</p>

<p>Although the discrete Fourier transform is mostly used to analyze
existing signals, we will focus on the synthesis of signals instead,
based on a given frequency spectrum. As it turns out, the frequency
content of many natural phenomena and/or shapes are fairly predictable,
in a sense. For instance, something as seemingly random as the  flood
levels of the Nile river over the years exhibit a frequency spectrum of
the form <i>1/f</i>, i.e., the power spectral density is very close to
inversely proportional to the frequency. Similarly, the shapes of various
mountains have fairly similar spectra &mdash; they mostly vary in their
phases. Therefore, one can easily synthesize a mountain shape by
generating complex numbers with a specific spectrum profile and
random phases, followed by an inverse discrete Fourier transform!</p>

<p><div class="points easy">2</div> Using the provided
<span class="code">ComplexNumber</span> class, write the DFT in the
<span class="code">FourierTransform::slow_transform</span> function found in
<span class="code">src/FourierTransform.cpp</span>.</p>

<p><div class="points easy">3</div>In lecture, pseudocode for a
recursive version of the DFT was presented; this is the FFT, or Fast
Fourier Transform. Implement the FFT in the
<span class="code">FourierTransform::fast_transform</span> function,
found in <span class="code">src/FourierTransform.cpp</span>. This
function takes the same arguments as the DFT version.</p>

<p><div class="points hard">5</div>In the file
<span class="code">src/SpectralSynthesizer.cpp</span>, implement the
(slightly modified) <span class="code">SpectralSynthesisFM2D</span>
algorithm, whose pseudocode is below, in
<span class="code">SpectralSynthesizer::getSpectrum</span>. <b>This
algorithm is taken from <i>The Science of Fractal Images</i> by Peitgen
&amp; Saupe; it does not belong to me, CS2, or Caltech.</b> This algorithm
generates the heights of a fractal surface by storing those heights in a
two-dimensional array <span class="code">A</span> of size <i>N</i> by
<i>N</i>. The parameter <span class="code">H</span> controls the fractal
dimension of the generated surface. You don't need to understand the
details, but <i>H</i> is a real number in the range 0 &lt; <i>H</i> &lt;
1 where smaller values of <i>H</i> give surfaces which are more rough
looking. The functions <span class="code">rand()</span> and
<span class="code">Gauss()</span> draw from random uniform and normal
distributions, respectively. We have provided similar functions
<span class="code">uniform()</span> and
<span class="code">gaussian()</span> for you.</p>

<div class="hint">We have provided a macro <span class="code">ndx</span>
that you can use to index a two-dimensional array; you may remember from
a previous assignment that this is not necessarily trivial in C++. So
you can write <span class="code">A[i][j]</span> from the pseudocode as
<span class="code">ndx(A, i, j, n)</span>, if <span class="code">A</span>
is to be interpreted as an <i>n</i>-by-<i>n</i> 2-dimensional array.</div>

<p>You may find it unusual that we are asking you to
translate code written in another language, rather than synthesize
your own code, for this objective. It is not uncommon to come across
an algorithm you would like to implement but are only able to find
in an "older" language, like FORTRAN in particular. Thus, this is a
useful skill to learn.</p>

or zoomed with Shift + mouse drag. You may also use the arrow keys
to see the effect of removing Fourier coefficients. The macro at the
top of <span class="code">src/FourierTransform.hpp</span> determines
whether the DFT or FFT will be used to compute the surface; feel free
to test both of your algorithms.</p>
