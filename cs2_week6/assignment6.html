<h1>CS2 Assignment 6: Multithreading and concurrency</h1>
<h2>Due Tuesday, February 18, 2014 at 17:00</h2>

<hr />

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This is the CS2 assignment on multithreading and concurrency. This
assignment consists of a debugging exercise, a warm-up exercise,
and a practical application exercise.</p>

<p>When finished, please enclose your submission as a ZIP file named
<span class="code">cs2week6-[NAME].zip</span> or a tar.gz file named
<span class="code">cs2week6-[NAME].tar.gz</span>, and upload it to the
Week 6 assignment module on Moodle.</p>

<h2>Assignment Background</h2>

<h3>The Dining Philosophers problem</h3>

<div class="attention">This is a very famous problem in computer science,
so there are many solutions available online. <b>You should not need
to access outside information about the dining philosophers problem in
order to complete the assignment. This includes both discussions of
theory and source code written by others.</b> As always, consulting man
pages or other C++ language resources is acceptable.</div>

<p>A simple and thorough problem statement for the dining philosophers
is quoted here from the Wikipedia article.</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>Five silent philosophers sit at a table around a bowl of spaghetti.
A fork is placed between each pair of adjacent philosophers.</p>
<p>Each philosopher must alternately think and eat. However, a
philosopher can only eat spaghetti when he has both left and right forks.
Each fork can be held by only one philosopher and so a philosopher can
use the fork only if it's not being used by another philosopher. After
he finishes eating, he needs to put down both forks so they become
available to others. A philosopher can grab the fork on his right or
the one on his left as they become available, but can't start eating
before getting both of them.</p>
<p>Eating is not limited by the amount of spaghetti left: assume an
infinite supply.</p>
<p>The problem is how to design a discipline of behavior (a concurrent
algorithm) such that each philosopher won't starve; i.e., can forever
continue to alternate between eating and thinking assuming that any
philosopher cannot know when others may want to eat or think.</p>
</div>

<p>Depending on the algorithm, the system may experience deadlock
(a state from which no progress can be made) or not. Any valid solution
will allow all the philosophers to eat, though that may only occur
after an arbitrarily long time. We may want to prevent starvation,
which could occur if, for example, one philosopher gets to eat once for
every five times the others do (we assume that the philosophers are
identical and require the same amount of spaghetti to function). We
will explore a few scenarios in this assignment.</p>

<p>The dining philosophers problem is obviously an abstract problem, but
it does have practical applications. You could replace the forks by
any shared resource &mdash; hard drives, printers, etc. &mdash; and the
philosophers could be replaced by any processes competing for those
resources.</p>

<h3>What is raytracing?</h3>

<p>Some tasks are prohibitively slow even when implemented in a compiled
language like C++; one example is raytracing, and a common solution
to this problem is multithreading.</p>

<p>We will <i>not</i> be asking you to write a raytracer in this
assignment, but you should understand how the process works in general.
<b>Please note that the images below are shamelessly taken from
<a href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/~rademach/xroads-RT/RTarticle.html">Ray
Tracing: Graphics for the Masses</a>.</b> How will we represent the real
world in a graphics-friendly way? One way is to define a single point
for an "eye" (the viewer) and a plane surface for the viewport (what you
see on your screen). Then a pixel on the viewport is colored according to
what a ray from the eye through that viewport pixel would see. In the
"world," we define objects (spheres, planes, etc.) and lights (which
illuminate the objects but cannot be seen themselves).</p>

<center><img src="images/eye_window.jpg" /></center>

<p>The natural question to ask now is, how do we know what color that
pixel should be at all? Enter raytracing. A naive approach to this
problem would be to define every possible ray extending from every light,
check whether it intersects an object, and, if it does, check if the
reflection will hit the viewport. This is a very bad idea! All the rays
that didn't intersect an object or the viewport will be deleted, so
there was no point in calculating them anyway. A scheme like this
is visualized in the figure below. See all the wasted rays?</p>

<center><img src="images/naive_raytracing.jpg" /></center>

<p>Clearly, this is not the best way to proceed. What if we work the
problem backwards? Trace every ray from the eye through the viewport;
if a ray intersects an object, check to see if light would illuminate
that point and, if so, color the viewport accordingly. All of <i>those</i>
rays must intersect the viewport, which means much less waste (compare
the image below with the previous one). This should give you a basic
idea of how the provided raytracer works. If you're more curious
you can look at
<a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4620/2011fa/lectures/08raytracingWeb.pdf">
Cornell's Raytracing Basics</a>.</p>

<center><img src="images/smart_raytracing.jpg" /></center>

<p>For a 600x800 pixel image (the size you will be using),
you must trace a minimum of 480,000 rays from the eye to the
viewport, not to mention determining whether light rays will
illuminate a particular point (for N lights, you would do this N
times for every ray that intersects an object). That's a lot of
computation, and we can improve speed by taking advantage of
multithreading.</p>

<p>Multithreading can be used to break up a process so that independent
parts of it can execute at the same time; in the best case scenario,
if you have two threads executing at the same time, you could improve
speed by a factor of two. You will see in this assignment that
raytracing can be made significantly faster by running multiple threads
at once.</p>

<h2>Assignment (20 points)</h2>

<p>For this assignment, you will demonstrate your debugging skills,
solve the dining philosophers problem, parallelize a provided
singlethreaded raytracer.</p>

<h3>Part 0: Debugging</h3>

<p><div class="points easy">3</div>In the file
<span class="code">reader/reader.cpp</span>, there is an implementation
of a queue. This queue is used to store lines of input from the terminal,
and prints the first few lines after the end of file is reached
(Ctrl-D from the terminal). The code does run, but it currently has
issues with memory. Using valgrind, find and fix all memory
issues in this code.</p>

<h3>Part 1: Dining Philosophers</h3>

<div class="attention">This is a very famous problem in computer science,
so there are many solutions available online. <b>You should not need
to access outside information about the dining philosophers problem in
order to complete the assignment. This includes both discussions of
theory and source code written by others.</b> As always, consulting man
pages or other C++ language resources is acceptable.</div>

<p>The full problem statement is given in the Assignment Background
above. <b>These objectives are to be completed in the
<span class="code">philosophers</span> directory.</b>You will be working
with three main C++ classes: <span class="code">Fork</span>,
<span class="code">Philosopher</span>, and
<span class="code">TalkingPhilosopher</span>. Some of these are
incomplete, and you will be asked to fill in specific parts to
demonstrate two different solutions to the problem. The code that spawns
each philosopher in a new thread and calls the correct function to
determine his behavior is provided for you. We also provide, in
<span class="code">Thread.h</span>, classes
<span class="code">Thread</span>, <span class="code">Mutex</span>,
and <span class="code">Semaphore</span> for you to use.</p>

<p>To make your task easier, we have provided a simple visualizer
for the philsophers-forks system. An example of the output is
shown below. Forks that are unclaimed will appear between the
philosophers; claimed forks appear under the philosopher who
has them. The asterisk indicates a dirty fork. Remember that the
system wraps around at the ends!</p>

<img src="images/philosophers_visualizer.jpg" />

<p><div class="points easy">1</div>A fork may only be used by one
philosopher at a time. There is a concurrency primitive exactly
suited to this scenario. Demonstrate your understanding of that
primitive by filling in the <span class="code">Fork::pick_up()</span>
and <span class="code">Fork::release()</span> functions. You may add
public or private members and modify the constructor and destructor
as you see fit.</p>

<p><div class="points easy">1</div>You have been provided a guaranteed
deadlock solution, named <span class="code">greedy</span>; run
<span class="code">philosophers -g</span> at a terminal prompt to
observe its behavior. In a file named <span class="code">README</span>
in the <span class="code">philosophers</span> directory, describe in a
few sentences the algorithm that is governing the philosophers' behavior
and why this "solution" will always deadlock.</p>

<p>One way to prevent deadlock is to limit the number of philosophers
that can sit at the table at any one time, which limits the number that
are competing for forks. We'll call this solution
<span class="code">waiter</span>, since it is as if the philosophers
must ask a waiter for permission to sit down.</p>

<p><div class="points easy">1</div>Determine the maximum number of
philosophers that can sit at the table at any one time. In the
same <span class="code">README</span> file, give this number and
describe how you arrived at it. This can be a logical argument &mdash;
there is no need for a formal proof.</p>

<p><div class="points easy">3</div>Using the
<span class="code">greedy</span> solution as a guide, fill in the
function <span class="code">waiter</span> to implement this solution.
You may use any appropriate concurrency primitives and define any local
or global variables you need. Again, consulting the documentation may
be helpful. Run <span class="code">philosophers -w</span> at
a terminal prompt to observe the behavior of your algorithm. <b>Your
solution should not deadlock, and every philosopher should eventually
eat, or it is not a solution.</b></p>

<p>In October 1984, K. M. Chandy and J. Misra published a paper in
<i>ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems</i> (volume 6,
number 4, pages 632-646) describing their own solution to this problem.
It can be extended to an arbitrary number of agents (philosophers) and
resources (forks), but it breaks the condition that the philosophers
cannot speak to each other; it also prevents starvation. Again, the
Wikipedia description is quite thorough, so I will quote it here:</p>

<div class="quote">
    <ol>
        <li>For every pair of philosophers contending for a resource,
            create a fork and give it to the philosopher with the lower
            ID. Each fork can either be <i>dirty</i> or <i>clean</i>.
            Initally, all the forks are dirty. <b>[This part has been
            done for you.]</b></li>
        <li>When a philosopher wants to use a set of resources
            (<i>i.e.</i> eat), he must obtain the forks from his
            contending neighbors. For all such forks he does not have,
            he sends a request message.</li>
        <li>When a philosopher with a fork receives a request message,
            he keeps the fork if it is clean, but gives it up when it is
            dirty. If he sends the fork over, he cleans the fork before
            doing so.</li>
        <li>After a philosopher is done eating, all his forks become
            dirty. If another philosopher had previously requested one of
            the forks, he cleans the fork and sends it.</li>
    </ol>
</div>

<p><div class="points easy">1</div>This solution will only prevent
deadlock when the system begins in an asymmetric state; the philosopher
numbering requirement implicitly breaks the symmetry. In your
<span class="code">README</span> file, explain what would happen if we
began this solution from a state where all philosophers begin with
dirty, left forks.</p>

<p><div class="points hard">5</div>You have been given a skeleton class,
<span class="code">TalkingPhilosopher</span>, which inherits from the
<span class="code">Philosopher</span> class. Add any member functions
you need to develop your own implementation of the Chandy-Misra solution
described above, and implement your algorithm in the function
<span class="code">talking</span>. Remember that the philosophers are
running in their own threads, so they need to communicate in a
thread-safe way. You may find the global array of philosophers helpful
when you want a pointer to a philosopher with a particular ID. <b>Your
solution should not deadlock, and every philosopher should eventually
eat, or it is not a solution.</b> You can run
<span class="code">philosophers -t</span> at a terminal
prompt to observe your algorithm's behavior.</p>

<h3>Part 2: Raytracing</h3>

<p>You should familiarize yourself with the provided raytracer
framework in the <span class="code">raytracer</span> directory. The
following classes may be particularly important.</p>

<ul>
	<li><b><span class="code">Entity</span>:</b> A base class for world
        objects, which determines all the functions such an object must
        have. The only Entity that is currently defined is the
        <span class="code">Sphere</span>. Relevant files are
        <span class="code">src/Entity.h</span>,
        <span class="code">src/Sphere.h</span>, and
        <span class="code">src/Sphere.cpp</span>.</li>
	<li><b><span class="code">Light</span>:</b> A
        <span class="code">Light</span> describes a virtual light in
        world space. Remember that lights cannot be seen themselves, but
        their effects can. The only <span class="code">Light</span> that
        is currently defined is the <span class="code">PointLight</span>.
        Relevant files are <span class="code">src/Light.h</span>,
        <span class="code">src/PointLight.h</span>,
		and <span class="code">src/PointLight.cpp</span>.</li>
	<li><b><span class="code">Ray</span>:</b> Defines a geometric ray
        with an origin (a <b><span class="code">Vertex</span></b>)
		and a displacement (also a <span class="code">Vertex</span>).
        Thus, the endpoint of a <span class="code">Ray</span> is just
        the origin plus the displacement. Relevant files are
		<span class="code">src/Ray.cpp</span>,
        <span class="code">Ray.h</span>, and
        <span class="code">src/structs.cpp</span>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Other classes may generally be treated as black boxes, and you will
find full documentation when you generate the Doxygen. You will be using
the <span class="code">RaytracerSinglethreaded::run()</span> function
as a guideline to write the
<span class="code">RaytracerMultithreaded::run()</span> function. You
can view the raytracer output by running
<span class="code">bin/raytracer</span> at a terminal prompt, with
the appropriate option for single- or multi-threaded.</p>

<p><div class="points easy">3</div>The function
<span class="code">run()</span> in
<span class="code">src/RaytracerSinglethreaded.cpp</span> calculates a
ray through the eye and a single pixel on the viewport; it calls
<span class="code">trace()</span> on each of these rays.
<span class="code">trace()</span> determines the correct color for the
pixel and returns it, and <span class="code">run</span> paints the color
on the viewport. Parallelize the <span class="code">run()</span>
function by spawning at least two threads to handle different parts of
the viewport. For example, one thread could paint the left half and
another could paint the right half.</p>

<p><div class="points easy">2</div>There is a
<span class="code">memcheck</span> target in the Makefile for this
assignment that will build a version of the code that renders a
single frame and then exits. Use this to resolve all your memory
leaks. If you use this Makefile target, you will need to
<span class="code">make clean</span> and <span class="code">make raytracer</span>
afterwards to revert to the normal behavior.</p>

<h4>Helpful hints</h4>

<p>You cannot call a member function from a thread
directly; if this is something you would like to do, you will need to
wrap it in a non-class function first, like this:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint code">
class Foo
{
    Foo() { }
    ~Foo() { }

    void f() { /* Do something interesting here. */ }
};

void *f_wrapper(void *arg)
{
    Foo *fptr = (Foo *) arg;
    fptr->f();
}

Foo *f = new Foo();
Thread *t = new Thread();
t->run(f_wrapper, (void *) f);
</pre>

<p>The overhead associated with creating a thread is high, so you should
try to create as few threads as possible and give them as much to do
as possible. You will need at least a dual-core processor to observe
the increased frames-per-second rate from multithreading.</p>

<p>The Makefile provided has a <span class="code">callgrind</span>
target that produces a file which you can view with kcachegrind if
you would like. It will tell you how many times each function was
called, how long it took to run, who called it, etc. If your code
is unreasonably slow, this is a good debugging tool. However, if you use
this Makefile target, you will need to <span class="code">make clean</span>
and <span class="code">make raytracer</span> afterwards to revert to the
normal behavior.</p>
