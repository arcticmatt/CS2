WHAT we contributed
Matt: Worked on implementing the random move algorithm and the minimax tree.
Helped clean up the code.
Keegan: Worked on implementing the heuristic algorithm and the minimax tree.
Also tested our bot for time, and experimented with various depths for minimax.
As for HOW we contributed these things, well, we coded them.

As for improvements...
We used a good heuristic array. We made it dynamic as well, by changing the
weightings over time. We saved memory by using an iterative method instead
recursive method. We went far in depth to ensure we beat BetterPlayer every
time. We think our strategies will work because our Heuristic is really good (
for example, a very low value placed on number of pieces on the board), which,
combined with the depth to which we look ahead, makes for a formidable
opponent. We tried to multithread it but ran into a bunch of compiler issues,
so we aborted that plan. We also tried alpha-beta pruning, but in the end
decided that we weren't going deep enough for it to be that useful.
